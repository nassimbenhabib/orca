iDynTree 0.8.1 Release Notes
=========================

Bug Fixes
---------
* The `toEigen(const SpatialMotionVector & vec)` and `toEigen(const SpatialForceVector & vec)`  inline helpers functions in the `iDynTree/Core/EigenHelpers.h` have been modified to return a **`const`** copy of their content. 
While this is technically an API change, it was critical because most of the other `toEigen` methods return an `Eigen::Map` object, and users 
expect to be able to use `Eigen` modifiers methods such as `toEigen(...).setZero()`. Enforcing a compilation error in this case will help to prevent subtle bugs.
As this is an `inline` function, this modification does not affect `iDynTree`'s `ABI` ( https://github.com/robotology/idyntree/pull/378 ) .

* The CMake configuration files of the release `0.8.0` were generated with the wrong version `0.7.2`.
